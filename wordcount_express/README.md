# WordCount Express

This is a simple NodeJS Express application using EclairJS and the standard Apache Spark "wordcount" example.

The intent of this example is to demonstrate hooking together a NodeJS application, Spark via EclairJS and a web UI via a web socket.  

It goes along with a [tutorial blog post](https://developer.ibm.com/open/2016/10/26/write-your-first-node-js-express-app-with-eclairjs/) that walks through each of the steps involved in setting this up assuming little or no experience.
